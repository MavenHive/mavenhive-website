      "content": "I have worked with MavenHive for several months now and have recently started a second project with them. They have been very efficient and quick to respond to ever changing business requirements. They have taken keen interest in understanding features and have offered valuable advice about interaction design. Their experience in building tools for the Non-profit organisations in the past is evident in how they employ a build vs buy strategy. Overall, a well oiled and reliable product development team that has delivered consistently despite operating in a remote work mode."

      "content": "The reason we'd recommend Mavenhive is that they actually get it. A lot of contractors don't. We could go to them with a half-baked wire frame and our code base all over the place and they would get back with a plan, a timeline and a workflow for us. They understand the full product development cycle. They just get it and that's why we love to work with them and will work with them in future."

At one time, we had a huge requirement which needed them to expand their team. Within no time, they hired and trained a 7 member team, which worked with us through the project. They adhere to high standards of development. Looking back we feel we made a very good decision."

They do a great job of ensuring that there is continuous integration and deployment. Another practice that they comply with is test-driven development which is not exactly followed by all vendors. There is no compromise on getting a good solution in place. They also understand the challenges faced by a product and are flexible to accommodate any changes needed at any point of time."
